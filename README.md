# Network Monitoring at Home (NM@H) #
(Slightly less provisional name than the previous one)

An example application of gopacket (github.com/google/gopacket) for sniffing and recording packet metadata on a small network.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
